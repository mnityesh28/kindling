Academic dbms project.
It is an online partner finding web application that allows users to anonymously find his/her perfect match based on their age, height and common interests etc. Once the profiles are matched,they can exchange messages. For the person who is using the application for the first time, the application will prompt the user to register first. In the Registration page He will enter his Name,e-mail address,gender,age,profile photo,qualification,address and a small bio which will have his/her likes and dislikes. After registering the profiles in which he/she is interested  will be shown, If the user feels his profile is matching with the other,then can send a request or skip the profile. If he/she approves it then a chatbot will appear where they can interact. If any of the individuals finds the conversation not in his/her context can block the conversation and come out of the chatbot.
